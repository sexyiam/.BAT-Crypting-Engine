What's different from Phantom?
* Uses Shellcode Injection instead of reflective loading.
* Supports only .NET payloads for now. || Change to Multi-support?
* The Bat obfuscation doesn't read from ps1 code from itself rather stores on a temp server i.e. internet connection mandatory.
* No AMSI bypass for now(A TODO) || Add a patchless method? like hooks
* Basic Startup method. || Task scheduler?
* 0.5~1ms popup appear time.
* Very Silent.
* The crypting engine inside is called BadEncoder.

PS - This is just a base you can add rootkit and stuff by yourself.

**No code of Phantomw as referenced here. I just like the name**

**This might be sigged as its old source but hardly takes few fixes to get it up running.**
