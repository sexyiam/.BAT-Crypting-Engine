What's different from Phantom?
* Uses Shellcode Injection instead of reflective loading.
* Supports only .NET payloads for now.
* The Bat obfuscation doesn't read for ps1 code from itself rather stores on a temp server i.e. internet connection mandatory.
* No AMSI bypass for now(A TODO)
* Basic Startup method.
* 0.5~1ms popup appear time.
* Very Silent.

PS - This is just a base you can add rootkit and stuff by yourself.
